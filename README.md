# MsPowerBi_Churn
I utilize Power BI to construct a detailed churn report that aids in understanding customer retention and attrition. The report is structured with various data columns, which are as follows: RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, and Exited. Each row represents an individual customer, providing a comprehensive view of their profile and banking behavior. This data arrangement allows me to analyze patterns and trends effectively, helping in strategic decision-making related to customer management and retention efforts.
